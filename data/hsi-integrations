Therefore, the risk of even a very hazardous substance approaches zero as the exposure nears zero, given a person's (or other organism's) biological makeup, activities and location (See exposome).[13] Another example of health risks are when certain behaviors, such as risky sexual behaviors, increase the likelihood of contracting HIV.[14]","_id":"b5AiZePQPFhM8NzJ"}
